ai-colormap
===========

This is a university project to learn some artificial intelligence princples.

The main goal is to colour a map, each state (imagine its a country map) must receive a different color than it's neighbors, when it turns into
impossible, it clear it all and retry another solution.

The map is represented as a graph and the states are the nodes.
